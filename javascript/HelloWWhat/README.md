In order to stop too much communication from happening, your overlords declare that you are no longer allowed to use certain functionality in your code!

####Disallowed functionality:

* Strings
* Numbers
* Regular Expressions
* Functions named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar.
* Object keys named "Hello", "World", "HelloWorld" or anything similar.

Without using the above, output the string "Hello World!" to prove that there is always a way.
