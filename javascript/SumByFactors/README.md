#Sum By Factors

Given an array of positive or negative integers
```javascript
I= [i1,..,in]
```
you have to produce a sorted array P of the form
```javascript
[ [p, sum of all ij of I for which p is a prime factor (p positive) of ij] ...]
```
P will be sorted by increasing order of the prime numbers. The final result has to be given as a string in Java or C# and as an array of arrays in other languages.

Example:
```javascript
I = [12, 15] 
result = [[2, 12], [3, 27], [5, 15]]
[2, 3, 5] is the list of all prime factors of the elements of I, hence the result.
```
Note: It can happen that a sum is 0 if some numbers are negative!

Example: I = [15, 30, -45] 5 divides 15, 30 and (-45) so 5 appears in the result, the sum of the numbers for which 5 is a factor is 0 so we have [5, 0] in the result amongst others.
